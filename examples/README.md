# Examples README

Ideally, you would have worked through a few examples involving AbstractGPs.jl, as the code
in TemporalGPs.jl implements the (primary) interface specified there.
Equally, these examples stand alone, so if you're not familiar with AbstractGPS.jl, don't
worry too much.

The examples in this directory are best worked through in the following order:
1. exact_time_inference.jl
2. exact_time_learning.jl
3. exact_space_time_inference.jl
4. exact_space_time_learning.jl
5. approx_space_time_inference.jl
6. approx_space_time_learning.jl
7. augmented_inference.jl
